# Scala Improvement Proposals

This repository contains the proposals of the Scala Improvement Process.

For more details about the Scala Improvement Process, please read the
[documentation](https://docs.scala-lang.org/sips).

The SIP pages of the documentation website are generated from data in this
repository. The GitHub workflow `.github/workflows/generate-docs.yaml`
periodically executes the script `.github/scripts/generate-docs.scala`,
which generates the website content and pushes it to the repository
[scala/docs.scala-lang](https://github.com/scala/docs.scala-lang).
